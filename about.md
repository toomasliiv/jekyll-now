I am an engineering student working towards a Master of Science in Machine Learning at KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, Sweden. My bachelor was in Engineering Physics. I am looking for thesis work autumn 2021 and full time positions as Machine Learning Engineer or as a Data Scientsit from spring 2022. 

In machine learning, I am mainly interested in adversarial attacks, explainability and uncertainty estimation in the context of deep learning. My [bachelor thesis](http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-255824) explored variations of DeepFool and FGSM attacks. We managed to create a directed variation of DeepFool and to extend the attacks to L_0 norm. 

I have interned at Nasdaq during summer 2019 and part time after that, working with Monte Carlo methods for central counterparty risk calculations in finance. I have also intered at Megger during summer 2018, working with OCR and image processing. 

At KTH, I was part of the team in [International Physicists' Tournament](https://iptnet.info) in 2017 and 2018. Our most notable achievemnt is that we won the national qualifaction round and placed 8th of 18 temas in 2017. I am also involved in a student musical called [Fysikalen](https://fysikalen.se) and chariman/producer of its latest production SkattkammarÃ«n. 

Before univeristy, I worked at [Mycronic](http://www.mycronic.com) within R&D of ejectors of solder paste. During high school, I was one of the winners of the national science fair and took part of [Intel ISEF](https://student.societyforscience.org/intel-isef). I also competed in the [International Young Physicists' Tournament](http://iypt.org/Home) in Thailand 2015. 

On my spare time, I like to be outdoors and to grow vegetables.
