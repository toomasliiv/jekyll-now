I study Engineering Physics at KTH Royal Institute och Technology in Stockholm, Sweden. My interests lie broadly in mathematics, computer science, phsyics and recently also machine learning.

Previously, I have worked at [Mycronic](http://www.mycronic.com) within R&D of ejectors of solder paste. During high school, I was one of the winners of the national science fair and took part of [Intel ISEF](https://student.societyforscience.org/intel-isef). I also competed in the [International Young Physicists' Tournament](http://iypt.org/Home) in Thailand 2015. 

On my spare time, I like to be outdoors and to grow vegetables.
